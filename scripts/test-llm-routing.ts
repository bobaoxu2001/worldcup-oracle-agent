/**
 * Tests for the cost-aware LLM provider router.
 *
 * Run with:  npm run test:routing
 *
 * Verifies the PURE routing decisions (no network calls): DeepSeek is the
 * low-cost default, Gemini is the premium escalation for complex/ambiguous
 * queries, and the chain degrades to deterministic when no key is present.
 * These tests never touch probabilities, rules, or simulations — only which
 * LLM (if any) would write the prose.
 *
 * Exits with code 1 if any assertion fails.
