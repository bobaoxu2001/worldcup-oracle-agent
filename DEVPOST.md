## ⚡ Elevator pitch

WorldCup Oracle Agent is a **daily news-aware AI agent** for the 2026 World Cup. Ask it a football question in plain English and it plans the analysis, pulls the latest injury & squad news, runs 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations, shows how the news moves the odds, remembers the session in MongoDB, and answers your follow-ups — like a prediction model and a football news desk fused into one agent.

---

## 💡 Inspiration

Most "AI predictors" are either a static stats dashboard or a single LLM call that makes numbers up. Neither feels like an **agent**, and neither feels **current** — real football fans care about *today's* team news (who's injured, who got called up, who's suspended) as much as long-run ratings.

We wanted an agent that visibly **reasons in steps**, grounds its numbers in a real statistical model, stays **timely** by folding in daily news, and **remembers** — so a follow-up like *"does that injury change the prediction?"* actually works. MongoDB became the natural memory layer for that.

---

## 🔮 What it does

- **Understands** a natural-language question (English or 中文) and **plans** the right analysis across **10+ intent types**: match prediction · tournament forecast · **group qualification** · **team comparison** · **rules explanation** · **model explanation** · team analysis · path-to-the-final · scenario what-if · team-news digest.
- **Resolves** teams from casual names (`USA`, `Türkiye`, `the Netherlands`).
- **Pulls recent team news** (injuries, returns, call-ups, suspensions, tactics) for both sides and **classifies** each item (category · impact · direction).
- **Scores news impact** with a transparent, capped signal layer and shows **base vs news-adjusted** probabilities with per-outcome deltas.
- **Simulates** the matchup **10,000 times** (Elo → Dixon-Coles → Monte Carlo).
- **Explains** the result in plain English, plus a fan insight and an optional TikTok-style script.
- **Remembers** every session in MongoDB and answers **follow-ups** ("What if Germany's injured defender returns?").
- **Agent Memory Center** (`/memory`) makes the memory layer visible: backend status, recent sessions, stored news signals, last refresh.
- **Verified track record** (`/accuracy`) grades the agent honestly against the real tournament: a walk-forward backtest of the live engine over **every completed 2026 match** (each predicted from *only* the results before it), with top-pick accuracy, RPS-vs-baseline skill, a calibration table, and every single call on the record — cross-checked by an independent ridge Dixon-Coles model.
- **Global Voice Mode:** fans can ask predictions by voice and hear responses in **English, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, or Japanese** — native browser speech APIs, no extra key, with deterministic localized summaries (numbers never change) and optional Gemini-translated prose.

---

## 🛠️ How we built it

- **Next.js 15 (App Router) · React 19 · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS** — a dark "stadium-night" UI that reads well on a screen recording.
- **Prediction engine** — a TypeScript port of an Elo → Dixon-Coles bivariate-Poisson → Monte Carlo model. Match probabilities are closed-form; the tournament uses a seeded 10,000-run Monte Carlo over the **official FIFA 2026 bracket** (R32 slots 73–88, Annex C best-third routing — validated for all 495 combinations via `npm run validate:bracket`).
- **Agent pipeline** — plain, typed, inspectable functions in `lib/agent/*`:
  `planner → matchResolver → newsResolver → impactAnalyzer → predictionEngine → simulator → explanationGenerator → MongoDB memory`. The reasoning timeline shown to the user mirrors these steps.
- **News intelligence** — `lib/news/*`: a multi-source provider abstraction (**GNews live in production** / NewsAPI / SerpAPI / Google CSE), a deterministic keyword classifier, a MongoDB-backed `team_news` store, and curated demo signals as a zero-key fallback. **Contextual signals only** — injuries, suspensions, squad/tactics/form/team-tension — which may nudge probabilities within the capped impact layer; **football-data.org remains the source of truth for fixtures, results and elimination**, and LLMs never invent injuries or conflicts. Free-tier news can be delayed/rate-limited, so signals are cached (a failed fetch keeps last-known live signals).
- **DeepSeek hybrid LLM layer** (`lib/llm/*`) for intent understanding, analyst narrative, and Chinese localization — the deterministic engine remains the single source of truth for all numbers and rules.
- **Live tournament-state layer** (`lib/live-sports/*`) — API-Football fixtures/standings/injuries, MongoDB-cached, deterministically gating out eliminated teams (never the LLM/news).
- **Everything fails soft** — no MongoDB, no DeepSeek/Gemini, no news key? The app still runs end-to-end.

---

## 🍃 MongoDB usage (the memory layer) — ✅ LIVE on MongoDB Atlas

MongoDB is the agent's **memory**, not just a database — and it's **live in production on MongoDB Atlas** at https://worldcup-oracle-agent.vercel.app:

- **MongoDB Atlas persistent memory is live** — the deployed app connects to Atlas and persists across sessions.
- **Every intent type is saved to the `predictions` collection** — match predictions, tournament forecasts, group qualification, team comparisons, and rules/model explanations all persist, with `userQuery`, `intent`, `teams`, `prediction`, `simulationResult`, `reasoningSteps`, `explanation`, `followUpContext`, `createdAt`, plus the extended structured fields (`summary`, `rankings`, `modelFactors`, `rulesApplied`, `newsSignals`, `limitations`, `confidence`, `language`) and the **`llmProvider`** that produced the narrative (`deepseek` / `gemini` / none). The schema extension is backward-compatible, so older records still render. `/memory` shows each session's **intent-type badge**.
- **Team news is stored in the `team_news` collection** — classified daily signals, indexed on `team + publishedAt`, `category`, `impactLevel`, `demo`.
- **Follow-up context** is stored alongside predictions so "what-if" questions re-analyse the right matchup and news.
- **`/memory` shows the backend status and recent saved sessions** read straight from MongoDB.
- **The Data Transparency card on every result shows `Memory: MongoDB Atlas`** (i.e. `persisted: mongodb`) so judges can see the session was written to the database.

Status is also exposed as JSON at `GET /api/memory/status`. The design stays fail-soft: if the database is ever unreachable, a global in-process store transparently takes over so the agent never blocks — but in production it runs on Atlas.

---

## 🤖 Cost-aware hybrid LLM layer — DeepSeek (default) + Gemini (premium escalation) · deterministic engine = source of truth

The agent uses a **cost-aware provider router**: DeepSeek handles routine narrative/localization tasks, while Gemini is reserved for complex multi-step reasoning, ambiguous intent resolution, and fallback. Deterministic TypeScript code owns every number; the LLM layer only handles language.

**Provider chain (`lib/llm/provider.ts`):**

1. **Deterministic router first** — if the heuristic parser confidently classifies the intent and the engines produce a structured result, that result is the source of truth (numbers, rules, simulations, rankings).
2. **DeepSeek — the low-cost default** (`deepseek-chat` via REST): routine intent refinement, standard analyst narrative, Chinese localization, team comparison, model explanation, and most common questions.
3. **Gemini — premium escalation** (`gemini-2.5-flash` via REST): `selectLLMProvider()` routes a query to Gemini when `assessComplexity()` flags it — multi-step tournament reasoning, **path-to-final**, **group qualification / best-third-place** logic, **rules + prediction combined**, **more than two teams**, ambiguous intent, low deterministic confidence, or long-form Chinese explanations. Gemini is also the **fallback when DeepSeek fails/times out**.
4. **Graceful fallback** — if Gemini isn't configured → DeepSeek; if neither is configured → deterministic templates. No loss of correctness.

```
selectLLMProvider(structuredResult, query, language, complexity) → "deepseek" | "gemini" | "none"
```

> **Hard rules:** the structured JSON is the LLM's **only** source of truth — it copies probabilities/rankings verbatim and is forbidden from inventing probabilities, news, injuries, suspensions, or sources. We deliberately do **not** claim "Gemini generates all answers."

**Gemini function-calling — the LLM drives the pipeline.** Beyond narrating, we ship a real **Gemini tool-use loop** (`lib/llm/geminiAgent.ts`): Gemini is given four declared tools — `resolve_team`, `predict_match`, `get_team_news`, `get_tournament_state` — and over a bounded multi-round loop it *decides* which to call. We execute each tool **deterministically** (the tools return the engine's own probabilities and the live elimination state), feed the JSON back, and Gemini synthesizes the final answer. **The engine still owns every number**; a system instruction forbids inventing probabilities, news, or eliminations. It's fail-soft (no key → the deterministic pipeline runs unchanged), inspectable at **`POST /api/agent/gemini-tools`** (which returns the full tool-call trace), **visible in the product** — every prediction answer carries a *"Watch Gemini drive the tools"* card that replays the question through the live loop and renders the trace — and **unit-tested offline** with a scripted fake model — `npm run test:gemini-agent` (14 checks, no network / key / cost). This is the honest version of "the LLM drives the pipeline": Gemini orchestrates the tools; deterministic code produces the facts.

**A real trace, captured from the production endpoint (4 July 2026):**

```
POST /api/agent/gemini-tools
{ "query": "Will Spain beat Argentina based on the latest news?" }

→ settled in 2 rounds. Tool calls Gemini chose:
   1. predict_match(spain, argentina)  → Spain 31% · draw 29% · Argentina 40%
   2. get_team_news(spain)             → 4 live signals
   3. get_team_news(argentina)         → 4 live signals

→ Gemini's answer (numbers quoted verbatim from the engine):
   "Argentina has a 40.1% chance of beating Spain, while Spain has a
    31.1% chance of winning, with a 28.8% chance of a draw. The expected
    score is 1.3 – 1.4 in favor of Argentina. … There is no significant
    news for either team that would alter these predictions."
```

Note what it did **not** do: it didn't guess a probability, and having read the live news signals it correctly reported they don't move the line — exactly the behavior the system instruction demands.

**Transparency:** every answer's **Data Transparency** card and the "Why?" badge show the **actual provider and its role** — `DeepSeek · routine narrative/localization`, **`Gemini escalation · complex multi-step reasoning`** (visible on path-to-final, group-qualification, and other multi-step answers), or `None · deterministic rules engine` — and the provider is persisted to MongoDB with the result. LLMs explain and classify; they never decide facts. Routing is covered by a unit test suite (`npm run test:routing`).

## 📊 Verified out-of-sample track record — `/accuracy`

Anyone can claim a model is accurate. We **grade ours in public**, against the real tournament, on the **[`/accuracy`](https://worldcup-oracle-agent.vercel.app/accuracy)** page:

- **Walk-forward, no peeking.** Every completed 2026 match is predicted using **only the results dated before it** — never its own outcome. This is a true out-of-sample test, not a curve fit.
- **Through 4 July (87 completed matches):** the live engine calls the right result **67% of the time (58/87)**, scores **+44% skill on the Ranked Probability Score** (the football-forecasting standard) vs a no-information coin-flip, and is **well-calibrated — ECE 3.6%** (when it says 70%, it happens ~70% of the time).
- **Two independent models agree.** The live stack is an Elo → Dixon-Coles → Monte Carlo engine in TypeScript. A **completely separate ridge Dixon-Coles** bivariate-Poisson model (Python, refit nightly, leave-one-out scored) lands on the same verdict: **+23% RPS skill, 75% accuracy on decisive results.** Two differently-built pipelines agreeing out-of-sample is the credibility check no single model can fake.
- **Every layer earns its place.** The page breaks down what each engine layer (result-learning, tactics, bounce-back, draw-propensity, confidence-calibration) adds to the RPS — this is *why* the agent is a pipeline, not one number.
- **Every call on the record**, filterable to the misses. We show the losses, we don't hide them.
- **Reproducible:** `npm run backtest` prints the same numbers in the terminal (it's a thin CLI over the exact module the page uses), `npm run dc:backtest` reruns the independent Dixon-Coles fit, and `npm run test:track` guards the accounting (24 checks). Exposed as JSON at `GET /api/accuracy`.

## 📐 Rules-aware 2026 World Cup engine

WorldCup Oracle is **rules-aware**, not just a matchup model:

- **Official 2026 format & bracket** reused from a validated module (`lib/prediction-engine/bracket-2026.ts`) — 48 teams, 12 groups, top-2 + 8 best third-placed teams → R32 (Annex C routing, all 495 combinations validated).
- **FIFA group tiebreakers** in the correct order — points → overall goal difference → overall goals → head-to-head → fair play → FIFA ranking.
- **Configurable discipline model** (`lib/prediction-engine/discipline.ts`) — yellow-card / red-card fair-play points and suspension thresholds power the suspension-risk read and the "do cards affect group ranking?" explainer.

The agent can therefore **explain the rules** (best-third advancement, card/fair-play effects, tiebreakers) — in English or 中文 — not just output probabilities.

---

## 📡 Live tournament state (deterministic elimination)

So the agent never keeps predicting eliminated teams as champions, a **live tournament-state layer** (`lib/live-sports/*`) is the deterministic source of truth — **not** the LLM or news headlines. **It is live in production via football-data.org** (badge: `Live API` on fresh fetches, `Cached` from MongoDB):

- **Real sports data** via **API-Football / API-SPORTS** or **football-data.org** (fixtures, standings, results; injuries on API-Football), normalized to canonical team IDs and **cached aggressively in MongoDB** (`team_state`, `live_fixtures`, `live_injuries`; ~2h fixtures / ~8h injuries TTL) to respect the free tiers.
- **Conservative classification** (`active · qualified · eliminated · unknown`): elimination only from a finished **knockout loss**; group stage is never guessed, so the agent **never falsely eliminates** a team.
- **Deterministic gating overrides the model**: eliminated teams are dropped from champion/path/team analysis (title odds → 0). *"Can Portugal still win?"* after elimination returns a hard **"No — already eliminated"** the LLM cannot override.
- **Fail-soft**: API down → last cached state; no key/cache → **Demo** (all active, clearly labelled). Never fabricates eliminations.
- **Transparency**: a Tournament-State badge (`Live API / Cached / Demo / Unavailable`, last-updated, source, eliminated count) on answers and at `GET /api/memory/status`.
- News providers stay **article/injury context only** — never the elimination source of truth.

Covered by `npm run test:tournament`. A **`/schedule`** page surfaces verified fixtures/live tournament-state data when available, with **TBA** labels instead of invented details (drawn group pairings + official knockout bracket are exact; dates/venues stay TBA until verified).

---

## 🧩 Agent workflow & MCP-assisted development

**The app is designed around an explicit agent workflow** (not a single chatbot call):

```
intent planning → intent routing → rules/simulation engines → memory → LLM narrative → MongoDB persist
```

Each stage is a real, inspectable TypeScript function and the reasoning timeline is shown live to the user.

**MCP was used on the development & deployment side** (via connected tools in our agent IDE), not as a production runtime dependency:

- **Vercel MCP** — connected and used to inspect project/deployment/runtime state during the deploy; environment-variable management and the production redeploy were performed with the **Vercel CLI** (`vercel env add`, `vercel redeploy`).
- **Browser-automation MCP + Playwright** and a **local-preview MCP** — used to drive the live app and **capture the production screenshots** and verify behavior.

> **Honest scope:** this is an **MCP-assisted development/deployment workflow**. We did **not** use **MongoDB MCP**, **GitHub MCP**, or **Google Cloud Agent Builder**, and no MCP server runs inside the deployed app. MongoDB integration is a **runtime** integration via the official `mongodb` Node driver (see below); git operations used the `git`/`gh` CLI.

## 🧗 Challenges we ran into

- **Tournament correctness.** The 2026 format isn't a generic seeded bracket — it's fixed R32 slots plus FIFA's "Annex C" best-third routing (C(12,8) = 495 combinations). We encoded the official slots and wrote a deterministic bipartite matcher that produces a rules-valid third-placed assignment for **all 495**, verified by a test suite.
- **Keeping news honest.** Without a paid news key we use curated demo signals — so we label them clearly as "sample signals" and use generic player roles ("starting defender") to never fake attributions.
- **Making news *move* the model transparently.** We capped the news effect (≤ ±10 pts/team, redistributed 60/40 to opponent/draw) and render an explicit **base → adjusted** table, so the layer is explainable, never a black box.
- **Demo reliability.** Every external dependency (MongoDB, Gemini, news APIs) degrades gracefully so the flagship demo always works.

---

## 🏆 Accomplishments we're proud of

- A genuinely **agentic** product: a visible, inspectable pipeline with planning, tool steps, and memory — not a single prompt.
- **News-aware predictions** with a transparent base-vs-adjusted view.
- A **Data Transparency card** on every result — judges can see exactly what produced the answer (Elo · Dixon-Coles · 10k Monte Carlo · live/demo news · MongoDB/in-memory · DeepSeek/deterministic), reflecting the live runtime state. No black-box "AI numbers."
- A **rules-aware, multi-intent agent** — match prediction, tournament forecast, group qualification, team comparison, and rules/model explanations, in English and 中文.
- **Live or demo news, clearly labelled** — plug in a GNews/SerpAPI/NewsAPI/Google CSE key for live mode; otherwise honest, generic sample signals.
- **Official, validated** 2026 bracket (all 495 Annex C combinations pass).
- **MongoDB as a first-class memory layer** with a dedicated Memory Center.
- **Zero-config** end-to-end: clone, `npm install`, `npm run dev`.

---

## 🔭 What's next

- ✅ Native **Gemini function-calling** so the LLM drives the pipeline (planner → tools) — **shipped** (`lib/llm/geminiAgent.ts`, `POST /api/agent/gemini-tools`), ✅ **including the live tool-call trace in the agent panel** (a "Watch Gemini drive the tools" card on every prediction answer).
- **Richer live news** — cross-provider dedupe, real player entity resolution, recency weighting.
- **MongoDB Atlas Vector Search** over news + historical matches for "find similar situations."
- **Multi-turn memory recall** — the agent cites its own past predictions in follow-ups.
- A user **bracket builder** to simulate custom knockout paths.
