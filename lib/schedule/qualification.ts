/**
 * GROUP-STAGE QUALIFICATION → resolved Round of 32.
 *
 * Once every group has played all six round-robin games, the knockout field is
 * fully determined and we can resolve the official 2026 Round-of-32 slots to
 * concrete teams — instead of leaving them as "1A / 2B / 3rd→M74" placeholders.
 *
 * This is computed PURELY from completed results (via computeStandings):
 *   • Per group, the standings order gives the winner (1st), runner-up (2nd)
 *     and third place — exactly what the bracket's positional slots consume.
 *   • The eight best third-placed teams are the eight whose group-third row
 *     ranks highest across all 12 groups on the standard, computable ordering
 *     (points → goal difference → goals scored). FIFA's deeper tiebreak
 *     (fair-play, then drawing of lots) isn't derivable from results, so a
 *     deterministic group-letter fallback stands in — the same approximation the
 *     prediction engine uses for cross-group comparison.
 *   • The eight qualifying third GROUPS are handed to the Annex C resolver in
 *     bracket-2026.ts, which fixes each to its official third-placed slot.
 *
 * Nothing is invented: if the group stage is not complete, `complete` is false
 * and the R32 stays unresolved (the UI keeps showing positional slots).
