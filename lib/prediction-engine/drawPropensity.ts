/**
 * Group-stage draw-propensity correction — the "openers draw more than raw Elo
 * says" layer.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (and why it is NOT an Elo layer):
 *   The 11–15 June group openers drew at 50% (8/16); an Elo + Dixon-Coles model
 *   calibrated on general internationals expects ~23%. Even allowing for a small
 *   sample, World Cup GROUP matches — especially matchday-1 openers — are
 *   structurally cagier (rust, fitness, "don't lose first") and draw more than
 *   the league-style baseline. A walk-forward backtest showed the model's whole
 *   error budget was draws, not picking the wrong team.
 *
 *   Crucially, the fix is NOT to narrow the Elo gap: that would symmetrically
 *   inflate the UNDERDOG'S WIN probability, and the data showed favourites
 *   rarely LOST — they were HELD. So this layer adds mass to the DRAW outcome
 *   specifically, shrinking both win probabilities proportionally and leaving
 *   the favourite unchanged.
 *
 * Design (small, capped, transparent):
 *   • Only applies to genuine GROUP fixtures (both teams in the same group).
 *     Knockout / cross-group hypotheticals are untouched (they go to ET/pens).
 *   • Strongest for true OPENERS (neither side has played yet); tapered once a
 *     team has results on the board — a data-driven proxy for matchday.
 *   • The draw is multiplied up to a hard ceiling, never enough to make a draw
 *     an absurd outright pick. Target ≈ historical WC group draw rate (~28–31%),
 *     NOT this round's freak 50%.
 *
 * Pure helpers (drawMultiplierFor / inflateDraw) take their inputs explicitly so
 * the backtest can recompute them walk-forward; applyDrawPropensity is the
 * engine-facing convenience that reads current played-status from the results.

 * KILL-INDEX DAMPENER (V5.1 lesson, added 18 June).
 *
 * The 17 June England 4-2 Croatia rout exposed the limit of a flat draw boost:
 * a "resistant" underdog (Croatia: experience, midfield control) was still
 * dismantled because the favourite had ELITE kill power (Kane, set-pieces,
 * width). Inflating the draw the same amount for England as for a blunt,
 * possession-heavy favourite over-weights the draw exactly where it is least
 * likely. The broader matchday-1/2 data agrees: the lethal-attack favourites
 * (France, Argentina, England) WON, while the held favourites (Spain, Belgium,
 * Portugal, Brazil) were the cagey/possession types.
 *
 * So we shrink the draw boost by the FAVOURITE'S kill index — its tactical
 * `breakdown` rating (0–5). To avoid double-counting the tactical-matchup Elo
 * nudge (which already rewards a low-block clash) and to stay conservative on a
 * thin sample, the dampener fires ONLY for ELITE attacks (breakdown ≥ 4), and
 * never removes more than (1 − KILL_DAMP_FLOOR) of the boost — group games are
 * genuinely cagier, so even a lethal favourite keeps part of the cushion.
 *
 * A capped scouting-style prior, not a fitted constant; re-fit as data grows.
