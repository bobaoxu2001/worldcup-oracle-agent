/**
 * KNOCKOUT-PATH EXPLAINER — the "who would they actually have to beat?" layer.
 *
 * Raw champion odds already price the draw (the Monte-Carlo routes through the
 * real FIFA bracket), but they don't TELL you why a high-Elo seed is capped:
 * that it landed in a quarter with two other giants, or that its Round-of-16
 * lands on the hosts. This module makes that legible. It is pure analysis — no
 * Elo nudges, no betting — so it lives beside the engine and is consumed by the
 * agent's narrative and the schedule UI.
 *
 * It works off the OFFICIAL routing in bracket-2026.ts (slot definitions +
 * winnerOf tree) and a SEEDING (which team finished 1st/2nd/3rd in each group).
 * The default seeding is projected from the real recorded standings plus a
 * deterministic Elo read of the games still to play, so the path reflects where
 * things actually stand — not a from-scratch replay.
 *
 * For each round on a team's path it reports the opponent:
 *   • Round of 32 — EXACT (the other team in the team's own R32 slot).
 *   • R16 → Final  — the PROJECTED danger: the highest-rated team in the opposing
 *     sub-bracket (the most likely single opponent, clearly labelled as such).
 *
 * No engine import (avoids a cycle): remaining group games are projected with a
 * plain effective-Elo + host-bonus read, which is all the routing needs.
