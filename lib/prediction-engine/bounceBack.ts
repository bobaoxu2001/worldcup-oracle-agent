/**
 * ROUND-2 BOUNCE-BACK — a capped motivation + mean-reversion nudge for a
 * QUALITY team that UNDER-performed in round 1 and now faces a clearly WEAKER
 * opponent. The intuition (V5.1.2 addendum): a strong side that only drew its
 * opener will "come out firing" in round 2, especially against a weaker team —
 * and the single-game result-learning (K≈60) over-docks an elite team for one
 * draw, so part of that penalty should revert.
 *
 * This is the deliberate counter-weight to the V5.1.2 Finishing downgrade:
 *   • The tactical Kill-Index trim says "don't OVER-price a stumbled favourite
 *     on reputation" — it still can't break a packed BUS.
 *   • This layer says "don't UNDER-price one either" — vs a weaker, non-bus
 *     opponent the quality + motivation reasserts and they should score more.
 * They coexist: vs an elite low block the tactical penalty dominates (Fade); vs
 * an ordinary weaker side the bounce-back dominates (they go for the kill).
 *
 * STRICT GATES (so it only fires for the intended population):
 *   • Group fixture only.
 *   • The team is genuine QUALITY (base Elo ≥ QUALITY_FLOOR).
 *   • The team UNDER-performed (its cumulative result delta is negative — i.e.
 *     it dropped points it was favoured to win). This also implies it has played.
 *   • It is still the clearly STRONGER side here (effective-Elo gap ≥ GAP_FLOOR).
 *
 * SIZE (capped, asymmetric — a motivation bonus, not a zero-sum transfer):
 *   reversion  = REVERT_FRAC × |resultDelta|            (give back part of the
 *                                                        single-game over-penalty)
 *   motivation = MOTIV_K × (gap − GAP_FLOOR), capped     (bigger vs weaker foes)
 *   delta      = min(BOUNCE_CAP, reversion + motivation)
 *
 * A capped behavioural prior, not a fitted constant — re-evaluate as round-2
 * results land. Pure helper (bounceBackDelta) takes inputs explicitly so the
 * walk-forward backtest can recompute it.
