/**
 * MATCH STAKES — a "knows-football" rotation/motivation layer for the FINAL
 * group round.
 *
 * THE INTUITION (the central ask): a model that truly understands the tournament
 * should know that the LAST group game is not played at equal intensity by every
 * team. A side whose place is already settled — group win clinched, or safely
 * through with nothing left to climb to — routinely RESTS starters (Germany,
 * Argentina once they've locked things up), while a side still fighting to
 * qualify, or in a live race for top spot (Netherlands & Japan chasing first
 * place for a better knockout path), plays a full-strength XI. Raw Elo can't see
 * this, so it over-rates a coasting favourite in a dead rubber.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES: for an UPCOMING final-round group fixture, it trims the effective
 * rating of a team that has little left to play for (a capped, negative nudge —
 * rotation risk), and leaves everyone else untouched. It is deliberately a
 * BEHAVIOURAL PRIOR, not a claim about the actual team sheet: we never assert a
 * specific player is rested, and the size is capped so it nudges tight games
 * (where rotation matters most) without ever overturning a real gap.
 *
 * STRICT, HONEST GATES (so it only fires for the intended population):
 *   • Group fixture only, and only the team's FINAL group game (1 game left).
 *   • "Secured" = MATHEMATICALLY guaranteed a top-two place (we never guess this;
 *     it is enumerated over the remaining results — see classifyStakes).
 *   • Among secured teams we separate "place settled" (rotate) from "still racing
 *     for first" (full strength). A merely comfortable leader (≥ ROTATION_LEAD
 *     points clear) is treated as likely-to-rotate; a team level/near-level at the
 *     top, or one that still must get a result, is left at full strength.
 *
 * NOT applied in the Monte-Carlo tournament/group simulator (matchupRatings):
 * that replays the whole group from scratch, where "who has clinched" is
 * undefined and would be circular. This is a predictMatch-time signal for a
 * SPECIFIC upcoming fixture, computed from the real recorded standings.
 *
 * The magnitude is scaled by a coach `rotationTendency` (0..1) so a future
 * coach-profiles layer can make habitual rotators (pragmatic managers) rest more
 * and reluctant ones rest less; until that lands, every side uses the neutral
 * DEFAULT_ROTATION_TENDENCY. Pure helpers take inputs explicitly so a backtest
 * can recompute them walk-forward.
