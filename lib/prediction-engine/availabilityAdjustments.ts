/**
 * Squad-availability Elo adjustments — the "confirmed injuries / withdrawals"
 * layer that feeds the `squadStabilityAdjustment` slot in EloBreakdown.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, separate from ratings.ts and ratingUpdates.ts:
 *   • ratings.ts          — base May-2026 calibration (frozen).
 *   • ratingUpdates.ts    — deltas the model LEARNS from completed RESULTS.
 *   • this module         — a manual, sourced, CAPPED adjustment for squad news
 *                           that the results haven't priced in yet (a key player
 *                           ruled out, a captain withdrawing, etc.).
 *
 * Design rules (kept deliberately conservative so news can never dominate the
 * calibrated model):
 *   • Each entry is a single, real, SOURCED availability change.
 *   • Two ways to size the Elo hit (see entryDelta):
 *       (a) an explicit signed `delta` (legacy / when no clean value read), or
 *       (b) VALUE-DRIVEN — from the absent player's market value RELATIVE to
 *           his replacement, a role weight, and how completely he is out.
 *     (b) is the upgrade asked for on 16 June: the hit should reflect the value
 *     of the player actually missing from the XI AND squad depth (a thin bench
 *     hurts far more than a deep one), not a flat per-name guess. Losing a €60m
 *     centre-back who is replaced by a €10m squad player is a real structural
 *     hole; losing a €200m forward who is replaced by another €70m starter and
 *     is himself fit for cameo minutes is much less.
 *   • A team's entries are summed, then CLAMPED to ±SQUAD_STABILITY_CAP.
 *   • Long-standing absences already reflected in the May calibration get a
 *     small delta on purpose — we do not double-penalise the base rating.
 *
 * The effective rating the engine simulates with is:
 *     getEffectiveRating = getUpdatedRating (base + results) + availability
 *                          + confederation form
 *   …and, at FIXTURE level only, a tactical-matchup nudge (tacticalMatchups.ts).
 *
 * Editing: add/remove entries below and redeploy. Keep `source` populated — the
 * UI labels this as a manually-curated, sourced signal, never a live feed.
 * Market values are transfermarkt-style €m estimates, documented per entry.
 *
 * Last updated: 2026-07-02 — Spain/Austria R32 squad news: Nico Williams OUT
 * (right-adductor vs Uruguay, ~2 weeks) and Yeremy Pino OUT (shoulder sprain)
 * — the compounding detail is that Pino is Williams' natural replacement, so
 * the flank drop-off is priced as squad-option, not like-for-like; Lamine
 * Yamal's cameo discount REDUCED (0.3 → 0.15 fractionOut) now he is starting
 * and scoring again, though still minute-managed after the April hamstring;
 * Austria wing-back Phillipp Mwene ruled out (Rangnick presser). All sourced
 * from the 1–2 July match reports / pressers cited per entry.
